1: What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?

Hi Alex. First off, it was a pleasure taking your class and learning more about coding (even if the lessons at times weren't so straightforward). It was a nice complement as far as coding goes in this program (helps me learn at my work too, keeping an open mind).

Speaking of, I guess you could say I'm already working at my dream job (well, dream company), Esri. I didn't expect my first job to hit a home run, much less finding stability in this volatile tech industry (layoffs, am I right?). 

But I'll admit, I love my job as a Support Analyst for ArcGIS Enterprise, though if I had to do it all over again, maybe not start this program alongside my first job simultaneously lol, especially when just getting a Bachelor's after moving out. 

Though this program in one way or another allowed me to flourish in my role as a Support Analyst, I still have a bit of room to grow as far as learning other techniques and advanced GIS applications (more in a bit). 

In short, I want to eventually move to Minnesota to live with my girlfriend (and more, one day), and become a GIS Consultant on behalf of Esri, perhaps for local governments. It would help me actively practice my socializing skills, allow me to travel more, and keep doing what I love: learning the new things in tech.

2: What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?

What new things you may ask? Why, feel free to review the below:

Needless to say, these technologies and more excite me a lot: In learning more about them, in using them, in testing with them. Before becoming a GIS Consultant, it is my aspiration to become a Support Specialist, to troubleshoot more with these advanced technologies and assist customers.

3: What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?

I aim to continue one of my site suitability analysis projects (one I call Project Future Foundation), which looks at a myriad of data (from Census Bureau, to CDC, to Esri data) to find the best place to live within a given city by census tract (or barring that, zip codes). 

In this case, my extent would be looking at the Twin Cities Metro Area in Minnesota. I've previously worked on this project in a class by Professor Kane Diaz (also a graduate of this program) at CPP, in a Geodemographics course. It is my hope by completing this endeavor I can plan my move accordingly to Minnesota, after finding a suitable house in a given area, of course. 

I also aim to pursue a few certifications through work training at Esri (ArcGIS Enterprise being the first among them), to enhance my resume, before eventually going for my GISP (perhaps in a year's time from now).

Was a pleasure speaking with you about this. Take care, and I'll send an invite on LinkedIn.
